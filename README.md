# Pomodoro

## Ideas for features
### Core
* plays a sound on completion and possibly in the middle of the set (even when screen is off)
* Progress clearly visible
* works offline

### More  
* different themes -- smth round, something vertical, sand clock, smth black and white, smth 80s, smth future UI
* progressive web application -- works offline, shows push notifications for progress and when it's done
* animated progress and page transitions
* options -- length of set, pause, possibly sound effect, auto-start, turn off animations
* each theme as well as the options page gets its own route.
* possibly move between pages by swiping
